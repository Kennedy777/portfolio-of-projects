# Personal Portfolio - Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Project 1
This project is a web portfolio that was built for the Udacity's [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). The goal was to create a responsive web page describing some design work I have done in the past.

### My main focus for this project
This project contains no personal javascript code, intentionally. My focus has been directed toward writing readable HTML5 and CSS that would use proper elements, classes and ids, as well as just-enough styling rules that would complement bootstrap and other technologies utilized.

### Technologies utilized
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - for grid-based and responsive design, and image responsiveness
* [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/) - for material design, paper-card style elements
* [Freepik](http://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik) icons - for nicely designed social icons

### What I learned from this project
* Creating a sidebar
* Creating a sticky footer
* Playing with media queries for different rendering depending on which device is used and device orientation (portait vs. landscape)
* Using new HTML5 tags such as *header*, *aside*, *main*, *section*, *article*, and *footer*
* Targeting class and ids with regex in CSS
* Deepening my comprehension on how to use the Chrome Developer Tool 
* Creating hover transitions with CSS
* Writing markdown documents
